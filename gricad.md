# How to access data from GRICAD

 - If you don't have an account, create it [here](https://perseus.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/create-account/portal) (select chercheur in contract type if you have a permanent position or are a post-doc, doctorant if you are PhD) and ask to join the pr-sasip project.
 - Read carefully the [computation center documentation](https://gricad-doc.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/en/)
 - Once logged to dahu, you have access to the storage at : ```/summer/sasip```
 - For a more direct access, once you have set up a direct access to dahu via [this procedure](https://gricad-doc.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/en/hpc/connexion/#connecting-to-the-gateways-without-a-password) you can set up a local mounting via the command ```sshfs yourlogin@dahu:/summer/sasip /an_empty_local_directory```
