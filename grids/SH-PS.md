# regional Antarctic grid on a polar stereographic projection

This [directory](https://ige-meom-opendap.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/thredds/catalog/meomopendap/extract/SASIP/grids/SH_PS/catalog.html)) contains neXtSIM exchange grid files :

   - 12.5km_SH_circle.nc
   - 25km_SH_circle.nc
   - 50km_SH_circle.nc
   - 6.25km_SH_circle.nc


These contain the geographic coordinates of the center of the grid cell (plat, plon), as well as the geographic coordinates of all four corners of the grid (lat_corners, lon_corners). 

They also contain the cartesian coordinates of the corners (x_corners, y_corners, z_corners), and the angle between the grid y axis and a vector pointing north (ptheta), taken at the grid center.
