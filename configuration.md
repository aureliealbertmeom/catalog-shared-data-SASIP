## neXtSIM configuration files

To run neXtSIM you need several files :
   -  a mesh file that represents the grid at the initial step
   -  the bathymetry file
   -  atmospheric forcing files
   -  oceanic forcing files

And also some scripts to run a simulation :
   - a namelist (cfg file)
   - the run script (bash script)
