# Grid examples for neXtSIM_DG

[This directory](https://ige-meom-opendap.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/thredds/catalog/meomopendap/extract/SASIP/grids/catalog.html) contains several grid files that come from previous work with the old neXtSIM and NEMO, as well as some grids proposed for neXtSIM_DG. They are all netCDF files, but the content is subtly different, depending on the grid. Currently we have the following sub-directories :

 - [CREG](grids/CREG.md)
 - [NH_PS](grids/NH_PS.md):
 - [SH_PS](grids/SH_PS.md):
 - [Split_ORCA2](grids/split_orca2.md):
