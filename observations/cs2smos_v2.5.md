Original files are available daily in the freezing season (varies each year) for the period 2010 to present, each file corresponding to a 7-day average of the Pan-Arctic sea ice thickness.

Data are generally availaible every day from December to March. Other months may be only partially covered.


I (Guillaume) averaged all these daily files for each month to produce monthly files.

I also provide script to 1) download "daily" files; 2) Add the volume quantity to these files ; 3) rename the files in a simpler way (links); 4) produce monthly average files

Best,

Guillaume
