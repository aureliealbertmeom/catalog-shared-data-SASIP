## Atmospheric forcings

These forcings gather all surface atmospheric fields required to estimate surface *air-sea* and *air-ice* fluxes of momentum, heat and freshwater, by means of bulk formulae.

These fields are:
- Wind speed vector at 10m (`u10m,v10m`) `[m/s]`
- Air temperature at 2m (`t2m`) `[K]`
- Sea-level atmospheric pressure (`msl`) `[Pa]`
- Dew-point temperature at 2m (`d2m`) `[K]` or specific humidity at 2m (`q2m`)  `[kg/kg]`
- Downwelling shortwave (aka solar) radiation at the surface (`msdwswrf`)  `[W/m^2]`
- Downwelling longwave (aka infra-red) radiation at the surface (`msdwlwrf`)  `[W/m^2]`
- Total precipitation (`mtpr`) `[kg/m^2/s]`
- Snow precipitation (`msr`) `[kg/m^2/s]`
